abstract = {This paper presents the novel application of a collaborative population-based meta-heuristic technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to the scheduling of home care workers. The technique is applied to a genuine situation arising in the UK, where the provision of community care service is a responsibility of the local authorities. Within this provision, optimization routes for each care worker are determined in order to minimize the distance traveled providing that the capacity and service time window constraints are not violated. The objectives of this paper are twofold; first to exploit a systematic approach to improve the existing schedule of home care workers, second to develop the methodology to enable the continuous PSO algorithm to be efficiently applied to this type of problem and all classes of similar problems. For this problem, a particle is defined as a multi-dimensional point in space which represents the corresponding care activities and assignment priority. The Heuristic Assignment scheme is specially designed to transform the continuous PSO algorithm to the discrete job schedule. The Earliest Start Time Priority with Minimum Distance Assignment (ESTPMDA) technique is developed for generating an initial solution which guides the search direction of the particle. Local improvement procedures (LIP), i.e. insertion and swap, are embedded in the PSO algorithm in order to further improve the solution quality. The proposed methodology is implemented, tested, and compared with existing solutions on a variety of real problem instances.}

abstract = {Organizations providing home care services are inclined to optimize their activities in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for home care. In this context, home care providers are confronted with multiple, often conflicting, objectives such as minimizing their operating costs while maximizing the service level offered to their clients by taking into account their preferences. This paper is the first to shed some light on the trade-off relationship between these two objectives by modeling the home care routing and scheduling problem as a bi-objective problem. The proposed model accounts for qualifications, working regulations and overtime costs of the nurses, travel costs depending on the mode of transportation, hard time windows, and client preferences on visit times and nurses. A distinguishing characteristic of the problem is that the scheduling problem for a single route is a bi-objective problem in itself, thereby complicating the problem considerably. A metaheuristic algorithm, embedding a large neighborhood search heuristic in a multi-directional local search framework, is proposed to solve the problem. Computational experiments on a set of benchmark instances based on real-life data are presented. A comparison with exact solutions on small instances shows that the algorithm performs well. An analysis of the results reveals that service providers face a considerable trade-off between costs and client convenience. However, starting from a minimum cost solution, the average service level offered to the clients may already be improved drastically with limited additional costs.}

abstract = {The home care crew scheduling (HCCS) problem
is a planning task whose goal is to allocate a set of pro-
fessional caregivers in the most efficient way to perform a
number of assistencial and health care visits to the customers
private homes. This is part of an important trend in advanced
health care systems, to promote “independent living” spe-
cially in situations of dependency on long-term care. This not
only ensures a higher quality of life but also a lower cost for
society. Real instances of the HCCS problem are large and
highly constrained due to both caregivers’ contract limita-
tions and customers’ needs. This paper presents an advanced
parallel model that solves HCCS problems using a grid-based
asynchronous evolutionary algorithm (EA). Our approach
has been tested using a grid computing facility of up to 300
nodes. The algorithm is a modified (1 + λ) EA, parallelized
using a master/worker model that minimizes communica-
tion requirements and processor bottlenecks by distributing
both the execution of the EA operators and the evaluation
of solutions. We have used three large real-world instances
provided by a private company to perform experimentation
with different configurations of the EA and number of work-
ers. Results show that our algorithm achieves solutions that
clearly outperform the solution provided by the company and
the grid-based algorithm is able to handle real world HCCS
problems},

abstract = {In the Home Care Crew Scheduling Problem a staff of home carers has to be assigned a number of visits to patients’ homes, such that the overall service level is maximised. The problem is a generalisation of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Required travel time between visits and time windows of the visits must be respected. The challenge when assigning visits to home carers lies in the existence of soft preference constraints and in temporal dependencies between the start times of visits. We model the problem as a set partitioning problem with side constraints and develop an exact branch-and-price solution algorithm, as this method has previously given solid results for classical vehicle routing problems. Temporal dependencies are modelled as generalised precedence constraints and enforced through the branching. We introduce a novel visit clustering approach based on the soft preference constraints. The algorithm is tested both on real-life problem instances and on generated test instances inspired by realistic settings. The use of the specialised branching scheme on real-life problems is novel. The visit clustering decreases run times significantly, and only gives a loss of quality for few instances. Furthermore, the visit clustering allows us to find solutions to larger problem instances, which cannot be solved to optimality.}

  abstract={Home care service is recognized to be one of the major solutions to contain costs in health care. However delivering this service is not an easy task because of the large number of actors that participate in the process, of the variety of clinical and organizational decisions, and last but not less important, of the difficulty of synchronizing human and material resources at patient's home. In this paper we propose a linear integer scheduling model developed to support human resource short term planning in home care. In particular, the model deals with the problem of deciding (a) which human resource should be used and (b) when to execute the service during the planning horizon, in order to satisfy the care plan for each patient served by the home care providers. The scheduling model has been tested on different real data sets collected from two Italian home care providers. The weekly plans generated by the proposed model have been compared with the real ones. The main result is a significant benefit, in terms of the increase in service quality and in efficiency, obtained by using operations research techniques in the home care short term planning},

  abstract={A hyper-heuristic performs search over a set of other search mechanisms. During the search, it does not require any problem-dependent data. This structure makes hyper-heuristics problem-independent indirect search mechanisms. In this study, we propose a learning strategy to explore elite heuristic subsets for different phases of a search. For that purpose, we apply a number of hyper-heuristics with the proposed approach to a set of home care scheduling problem instances. The results show that the learning strategy increases the performance of the different hyper-heuristics by excluding some heuristics from the heuristic set over the tested problem instances.},

Sequencing home care nurses visits shows similarities with the multiple vehicle routing problem with time windows (MVRPTW). Additional constraints make this problem much more complex.

I deal with the problem of allocating resources to the home-care service provided to AIDS patients in the city of Rome, Italy, which include medical assistance provided by nurses and doctors and social assistance and accompaniment of patients provided by social workers. A simple linear programming model solves the problem for single organizations, which provide assistance within a given budget, and for public-health authorities, which have to evaluate the results of tentative budgets assigned to home care. },

In this paper, we develop a support system for a home care service, using a multi-agent system. The decision of a care schedule is performed autonomously by the negotiations among agents so that it is sufficient for clients and helpers to confirm schedules settled by the agents. They can confirm the schedules using PDAs, which can be easily handled even by elders. Consequently, it is expected that our support system reduces the total cost of a home care service.},

abstract = {Home care services provide care for the elderly, disabled or patients with chronic diseases. The cares are performed by nurses or unlicensed assistive personnels depending on the care to provide at the patient’s home. Usually, the work routing and scheduling of the staff members are realized by an experienced nurse playing the role of the coordinator. However, this kind of manual planning has its limits as the demand tends to grow and it has to be done every day for the day after. After reviewing the existing literature on this problem, we propose a mixed-integer programming model focusing on the different types of staff member employed by home care services. The objective is to minimize the cost related to the transportation and the working hours. In order to find an optimal solution, we suggest two solving approaches: a one-phase solving method where the full data set are considered as input in order to find the best possible solution to the problem and a two-phases matheuristic in order to distinguish the scheduling of the nurses and the unlicensed assistive personnels. The approaches are then experimented on several instances of different sizes in order to compare them.}
